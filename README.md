# Project-Planning-Shift

## Description
The "Project Planning Shift" is an integration solution developed for Odoo that simplifies the management of projects and resource allocation. When a project or task is created within Odoo, this module automatically generates corresponding shifts in the Odoo planning module. This automation bridges the gap between project management and workforce planning, ensuring that resource allocation is directly tied to project needs, which enhances efficiency, reduces manual errors, and streamlines operations across departments.

## Installation Instructions
To install the Project Planning Shift module, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a working installation of Odoo.

--addons-path=/path/to/your/addons,/path/to/project-planning-shift

4. Update your Odoo module list and install the module from the Odoo backend interface.

## Usage
After installation, whenever you create a project or task within Odoo, the corresponding shifts will automatically be created in the planning module. To view these shifts, navigate to the Planning module in your Odoo installation.
